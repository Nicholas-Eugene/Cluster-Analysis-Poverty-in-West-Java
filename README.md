# Cluster-Analysis-Poverty-in-West-Java
# Abstract

Poverty is one of the complex socio-economic issues that West Java needs to pay serious 
attention to. This study aims to analyze poverty data in West Java Province using two clustering 
methods: K-means and Fuzzy C-means. The data used in this study is from the 
opendata.jabarprov.go.id website, covering the period from 2002 to 2023. The Elbow method is 
used to determine the optimal number of clusters, while the Silhouette Score and Daviesï¿¾Bouldin Index are used to evaluate the performance of the two clustering algorithms. The 
analysis results show that the K-Means clustering method is more successful in identifying 
significant and relevant poverty patterns compared to Fuzzy C-Means, with a silhouette score of 
0.6679488458077552 and a Davies-Bouldin index of 0.39446313809805533 for K-Means 
clustering. The clustering results of K-Means can also be visualized through PCA plots.
